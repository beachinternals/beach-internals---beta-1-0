        ### On the Court:

        - Video the match.  See recommendations on videoing beach volleyball matches here, but generally:
          - Video the whole match in one fileVideo from the end line
          - Mount the camera as high as possible.  Higher camera angle will greatly improve the y coordinates  (depth coordinates)
          - Shoot the vide on 1080p high def (4k video is just too much data, and lower qualities make player identification more difficult)
          - Try to set the frame of the video small enough that other courts are not included in the frame, but wide enough to get the server in the video, including during their approach.
