        1) Competition Level - there are three potential levels that can be used to limit the data.  For example,  in the FIVB -- Maybe Elite 16, Gstaad, Pool play.  Or in the NCAA -- Regular Season, Both Top 20, 2's.  One of more of these filters may be applied, select the check box next to the filter to filter on that competition level.
        2) Date Range - by selecting this check box, then adding a start date and end date, this will limit the report to match dates within this window.

        #### Select the Report
        The drop down lists all available reports.  Select the desired reports, then select "Generate Report".
